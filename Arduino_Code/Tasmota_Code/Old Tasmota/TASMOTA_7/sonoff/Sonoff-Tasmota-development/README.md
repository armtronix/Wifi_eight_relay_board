# Sonoff-Tasmota
Alternative firmware for _ESP8266 based devices_ like [iTead](https://www.itead.cc/) _**Sonoff**_ with **web UI, rules and timers, OTA updates, custom device templates and sensor support**. Allows control over **MQTT**, **HTTP**, **Serial** and **KNX** for integrations with smart home systems. Written for Arduino IDE and PlatformIO.

## Development
[![Dev Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20version-v6.6.0.x-blue.svg)](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota)
[![Download Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-development-yellow.svg)](http://thehackbox.org/tasmota/)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota)

See [sonoff/_changelog.ino](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/blob/development/sonoff/_changelog.ino) for detailed change information.

The development codebase is checked hourly for changes and if new commits have been merged and compile successfuly they will be posted at http://thehackbox.org/tasmota/ (this web address can be used for OTA too). It is important to note that these are based on the current development codebase and it is not recommended to flash it to devices used in production or which are hard to reach in the event that you need to manually flash the device if OTA failed. The last compiled commit number is also posted on the same page along with the current build status (if a firmware rebuild is in progress).

## Disclaimer
:warning: **DANGER OF ELECTROCUTION** :warning:

A Sonoff device is not a toy. It uses Mains AC so there is a danger of electrocution if not installed properly. If you don't know how to install it, please call an electrician. Remember: _**SAFETY FIRST**_. It is not worth risk to yourself, your family, and your home if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Never try to flash a Sonoff device while it is connected to MAINS AC.

We don't take any responsibility nor liability for using this software nor for the installation or any tips, advice, videos, etc. given by any member of this site or any related site.

## Note
Please do not ask to add new devices unless it requires additional code for new features. If the device is not listed as a module, try using [Templates](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Templates) first. If it is not listed in the [Tasmota Device Templates Repository](http://blakadder.github.io/templates) create your own [Template](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Templates#creating-your-template-).

## Quick Install
Download one of the released binaries from https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/releases and flash it to your hardware as [documented in the wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Flashing).

## Important User Compilation Information
If you want to compile Sonoff-Tasmota yourself keep in mind the following:

- Only Flash Mode **DOUT** is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device. See [Wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Theo's-Tasmota-Tips) for background information.
- Sonoff-Tasmota uses a 1M linker script WITHOUT spiffs **1M (no SPIFFS)** for optimal code space. If you compile using ESP/Arduino library 2.3.0 then download the provided new linker script to your Arduino IDE or Platformio base folder. Later version of ESP/Arduino library already contain the correct linker script. See [Wiki > Prerequisites](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Prerequisites).
- To make compile time changes to Sonoff-Tasmota it can use the ``user_config_override.h`` file. It assures keeping your settings when you download and compile a new version. To use ``user_config.override.h`` you will have to make a copy of the provided ``user_config_override_sample.h`` file and add your setting overrides. To enable the override file you will need to use a compile define as documented in the ``user_config_override_sample.h`` file.

## Version Information
- Sonoff-Tasmota provides all (Sonoff) modules in one file and starts with module Sonoff Basic.
- Once uploaded, select [Module](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Modules) using the configuration webpage, the commands ```Modules``` and ```Module``` or configure the [Template](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Templates) for your device
- After reboot select config menu again or use commands ```GPIOs``` and ```GPIO``` to change GPIO with desired sensor.

## Migration Information
See [wiki migration path](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Upgrade#migration-path) for instructions how to migrate to a major version. Pay attention to the following version breaks due to dynamic settings updates:

1. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 3.9.x**
2. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 4.x**
3. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 5.14**
4. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 6.x**
