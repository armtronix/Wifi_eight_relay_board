# CLOSE ISSUE BOT
# ---------------
# A bot which helps you to close issues that don't include some specific contents.
# See how to use it in https://github.com/offu/close-issue-app.

# Comment that will be sent if an issue is judged to be closed.

  This issue has been automatically closed because the issue template is missing or incomplete.
  
  Filling the template is required so standard questions don't need to be asked again each time.
  Our ability to provide assistance is greatly hampered if few minutes are not taken to complete the issue template
  with the requested information. The details requested potentially affect which options to pursue. The small amount
  of time you will spend completing the template will also help the volunteers, providing assistance to you, to reduce
  the time required to help you.
  
  Please, could you be so kind on completing the [issue template](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/new/choose) in order to have more information so as to properly help you?

  Thank you for taking the time to report, hopefully it can be resolved soon.
